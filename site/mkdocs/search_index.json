Here is the process to follow when updating Drupal VM between minor releases:\n\n\n\n\nRead through the \nrelease notes\n and add/modify \nconfig.yml\n variables mentioned therein.\n\n\nDo a diff of your \nconfig.yml\n with the updated \ndefault.config.yml\n (e.g. \ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geerlingguy/drupal-vm/master/default.config.yml | git diff --no-index config.yml -\n).\n\n\nRun \nvagrant provision\n to provision the VM, incorporating all the latest changes.\n\n\n\n\nFor major version upgrades (e.g. 3.x.x to 4.x.x), it may be simpler to destroy the VM (\nvagrant destroy\n) then build a fresh new VM (\nvagrant up\n) using the new version of Drupal VM.",

If you use this method, you need to also\n#            provide a script via galen.browser.pageElement.areaFinder.custom.script property\ngalen.browser.pageElement.areaFinder = native\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate also the file \npackage.json\n, to install the \ngalen-framework-handler\n with this content:\n\n\n{\n  \ndependencies\n: {\n    \ngalen-framework-handler\n: \n^0.0.9\n\n  },\n  \ndevDependencies\n: {\n  },\n  \nengines\n: {\n    \nnode\n: \n=5.5.0\n\n  },\n  \nkeywords\n: [\n    \ngalen\n,\n    \ngalen framework\n,\n    \nresponsive\n,\n    \ntesting\n,\n    \nDrupalDevDays\n\n  ],\n  \nscripts\n: {}\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd, at the end, create also the file \nconfig.js\n that contains:\n\n\n/** Overriding the config variable defined in the galen-framework-handler **/\n\nconfig\n \n=\n \n{\n\n\n  \nbaseURL\n:\n \nhttp://drupalvm.dev\n\n\n};\n\n\n\n/** Overriding the devices to test variable defined in the galen-framework-handler **/\n\ndevicesToTest\n \n=\n \n{\n\n\n  \niphone7\n:\n \ndevices\n.\niphone7\n,\n\n\n  \nipadMini3\n:\n \ndevices\n.\nipadMini3\n,\n\n\n  \ndesktop\n:\n \ndevices\n.\ndesktop1024\n\n\n};\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the \nbaseURL\n parameter with your host URL.\n\n\n4. Install Galen dependencies\n\n\nFrom your \nvagrant\n machine, in the folder \ntests/ReponsiveTests/\n on your \ndrupal\n docroot, run:\n\n\nnpm install\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Run your first Galen test\n\n\nIn your project docroot, under \ntests/ReponsiveTests\n, create the folder \nspecs\n.\n\n\nCreate file 'test-index.gspec' in \nspecs/\n folder. Edit the file and add this code:\n\n\n@objects\n   # menu items\n   main-content xpath   //main[@id=\ncontent\n]\n\n= Main content =\n   # for all the devices\n   @on *\n       main-content:\n           visible\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder \ntests/ReponsiveTests\n create the folder \ntests/suites/\n.\n\n\nCreate file \ntest-index.test.js\n in \ntests/suites/\n folder. Edit the file and add this code:\n\n\n// important, commons should be loaded here\nload(\n../../node_modules/galen-framework-handler/dist/galen-framework-handler.js\n);\n\nload(\n../../config.js\n);\n\nforAll(devicesToTest, function (device) {\n  test(\nTesting on \n${\ndeviceName\n}\n, function (device) {\n\n    // here goes a test code\n    var driver = createDriver(config.baseURL, device.size);\n\n    // here is the \nkey\n of the galen-framework testing\n    checkLayout(driver, \nspecs/uew-index.gspec\n, device.tags);\n\n    driver.close();\n    driver.quit();\n  });\n});\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are ready to run your first test using \nGalen\n.\n\n\nFrom your host machine, move to the folder where you previously placed the \nSelenium Server\n (see \nGalen Requirements\n) and run it up:\n\n\ncd /my/selenium/server/standalone/folder\njava -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.4.0.jar\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom your \nvagrant\n machine under \ndocroot/tests/ReponsiveTests\n run:\n\n\ngalen test tests/suites/* --htmlreport reports/\n\n\n\n\n\nIf everything worked out, you\u2019ll see \nSelenium\n open up a new instance of the selected browser profile and drive it through the test suites.\n\n\n6. Git ignore Galen package files\n\n\nEdit the main \n.gitignore\n file to add the \nGalen\n package files.\n\n\nThe files/folders to ignore are:\n\n\n\n\nFolder \n/tests/ReponsiveTests/node_modules/\n\n\nFolder \n/tests/ReponsiveTests/reports/\n\n\n\n\n7. Cross-Browser test with Galen\n\n\nIn our \ngalen.config\n selenium is setup to run with \nchrome\n browser.\n\n\nTo test on multiple browser we need to setup a new config file for each browser.\n\n\nFor example, if we want to setup tests on \nfirefox\n browser, from your \nvagrant\n machine under \ndocroot/tests/ReponsiveTests\n run:\n\n\ncp galen.config galenfirefox.config\n\n\n\n\n\nThen edit the created file \ngalenfirefox.config\n and change the \ngalen.browserFactory.selenium.grid.browser\n parameter as below:\n\n\ngalen.browserFactory.selenium.grid.browser = firefox\n\n\n\n\n\nNow to run your test:\n\n\ngalen test tests/suites/* --htmlreport reports/ --config galenfirefox.config",

Also, to make sure you will require versions of your dependencies that will guarantee not to break other things, try to use the best combination to constrain versions. Check an example:\n\n\ncomposer require \ndrupal/ctools:^3.0@alpha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you wish to select the \nmodule\n version:\n\n\ncomposer require drupal/\nmodulename\n --prefer-dist\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd other dependencies\n\n\ncomposer require \nvendor\n/\nmodulename\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment dependencies\n\n\nThere are often components of your project that you need when doing development work, but you don't need on production.

CMI allows you to export all configurations and its dependencies from the database into yml text files. To make sure, you never end up in an inconsistent state, CMI always exports everything. By default, you cannot exclude certain configurations.\n\n\nTo export the configuration you must set the export directory in your Drupal settings. See \nConfiguration directory\n.\n\n\nThan you can export with:\n\n\ndrush config-export\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you change some configuration on the database, these configurations will be reverted in the next deployment when you use:\n\n\ndrush config-import\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is helpful and will make sure, you have the same configuration on all your systems.\n\n\nDifferent configurations on Dev / Stage / Prod environments\n\n\nYou want to have different configurations on your environments. For example, we have installed a \u201cdevel\u201d module only on our local environment but we want to have it disabled on the live environment.\n\n\nThis can be achieved by using the \nConfiguration Split\n module.\n\n\nConfiguration split exposes a configuration entity which controls what you want to split off. Currently you can\n\n\n\n\nblacklist modules\n: any configuration that this module owns will automatically be blacklisted too.\n\n\nblacklist configuration\n: settings or configuration entities. These will be removed from the active sync directory.\n\n\ngraylist configuration\n: settings or configuration entities.

CMI allows you to export all configurations and its dependencies from the database into yml text files. To make sure, you never end up in an inconsistent state, CMI always exports everything. By default, you cannot exclude certain configurations.  To export the configuration you must set the export directory in your Drupal settings. See  Configuration directory .  Than you can export with:  drush config-export  If you change some configuration on the database, these configurations will be reverted in the next deployment when you use:  drush config-import  This is helpful and will make sure, you have the same configuration on all your systems.",
